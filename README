NAME
    WWW::Finger - Get useful data from e-mail addresses

VERSION
    0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Finger;
  
      my $finger = WWW::Finger->new("joe@example.com");
  
      if (defined $finger)
      {
        print $finger->name . "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is *not* an implementation of the finger protocol (RFC 1288).
    Use Net::Finger for that. Instead it is a set of implementations of
    *other* methods for getting information from an e-mail address, or
    e-mail-like identifier. This package includes three such implementations,
    and it's pretty easy to create your own additional implementations:

    *       WebFinger

    *       Fingerpoint

    *       cpan.org scraper (for user@cpan.org)

  Constructor
    *       "new"

              $finger = WWW::Finger->new($identifier);

            Creates a WWW::Finger object for a particular identifier. Will
            return undef if no implemetation is able to handle the identifier

  Object Methods
    Some or all of these methods may return undef. The "name", "mbox",
    "homepage", "weblog", "image" and "key" methods work in both scalar and
    list context. Depending on which implementation was used by
    "WWW::Finger::new", the object may also have additional methods. Consult
    the documentation for the various implementations for details.

    "name"  The person's name (or handle/nickname).

    "mbox"  The person's e-mail address (including "mailto:").

    "homepage"
            The person's personal homepage.

    "weblog"
            The person's blog. (There may be some overlap with "homepage".)

    "image" An avatar, photo or other image depicting the person.

    "key"   The URL of the person's GPG/PGP public key.

    "webid" A URI uniquely identifying the person. See
            <http://esw.w3.org/topic/WebID>.

    "endpoint"
            A SPARQL Protocol endpoint which may provide additional data about
            the person. (See RDF::Query::Client.)

    "graph" An RDF::Trine::Model object holding data about the person. (See
            RDF::Trine.)
